risk-management-presentation
============================

A presentation about Risk Management I gave as an assignment for a module about Software Engineering at the University of Stirling. If you want to use this presentation just let me know.

The file .docx is useful to study the presentation, you can read more detailed information about the slides and learn something more to use during the speech you should give.

I used a lot of books and papers I found online, here are some of the most useful ones:
